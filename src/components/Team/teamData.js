    p1: `Married to my best friend who supports all my crazy health ideas! I am a mom to 4 kids who I
    love and adore and are a big reason for my passion for Holistic Health. I want to make sure what
    I feed them is as close to its natural form as possible, I am by no means perfect, they still
    have junk here and there, but the goal is simple and natural. I believe with my whole heart food
    really is the best medicine. What we put in our mouths directly effects our overall health
    including our mind and soul and  our body's ability to adapt to all the stress life throws at us.`,
    p2: `I have been a trainer for a little over 5 years now and love to workout, but my mind has slightly
    focused over the years to be more mindful of my mental state and becoming more aware of where my
    energy is being spent. As I have put more focus on the foods that work right for my body, adapted
    meditation, along with cold ice bath therapy, I have felt more empowered and stronger both physically
    and mentally! I want to help others achieve a stronger state not just physically but mentally as well.
    Simple Soul Az a passion for getting back to the basics.`

    p1: `I was born and raised into health. I had parents and grandparents who invested a lot of time and energy
    into providing good whole foods for their children as well as a balanced lifestyle that promoted nutrition,
    physical activity, and mental/emotional well-being. I will forever be grateful for that upbringing!`,
    p2: `I have always loved being active and love the endorphins that come with it! Being active has helped me keep up
    with my always-on-the-move husband and our five children. There was a time when I was feeling pretty awful and
    ended up doing a lot to fix my hormonal health. After working on my own health and learning more about how much
    nutrition and lifestyle affect our hormones, I worked for a Bio-Identical Hormone specialist in one of his offices
    in Scottsdale, Arizona. Since then I have incorporated the things I have learned into my life and the lives of my
    husband and children. When we are eating healthy foods (the majority of the time), getting enough sleep, living an
    active lifestyle, and making time to focus on our emotional health, we are all happier and have loads more energy to
    enjoy life! That way of thinking has been reconfirmed as I have learned about and studied epigenetics (hair analysis).
    I love helping others feel their best inside and out and feel like this is truly a way to do that!`

    p1: `Growing up with less fortune in Central Florida in a big family I learned how to live off the land.
    We grew and preserved food constantly. When I got older I began to realize what an important that has
    played in my life. I became a trainer before my 20s but my first child at 24 was my biggest teacher.
    He had eczema and reflux within weeks after birth. I had an epiphany while in a doctor's office with my baby.
    I drove home and changed my family's diet, our lifestyle and our environment to rid us of the toxins that were
    causing so many issues in our daily lives.`,
    p2: `I studied daily to learn everything I could about the human body and the mind.
    I became a Holistic Practitioner and started coaching clients in a whole new way.
    My passion lies with helping clients 1 on 1. Understanding where they want to be and what they want to achieve
    drives me to find the personalized solutions they need.
    Epigentic Hair Analysis has now given me a power tool when I has using basic hand tools before. A lot of the guesswork
    is taken out of helping clients on their health journey....and I'm in love!`

    p1: `Being a gymnast for 15 years, really taught me how important it is to fuel my body with good nutrients. 
    There came a time when I wasn’t fueling my body enough which showed in my performance. Being in school for 
    nutrition at the time emphasized the importance of fueling our bodies properly especially as an athlete.`,
    p2: `I graduated from ASU with a Bachelor’s degree in Nutrition and I am now married to my best friend. 
    I also did some personal training because I love moving my body each day and love the endorphins that come 
    with it. My passion is helping others understand their nutritional needs and helping them to feel their best 
    by overcoming illness, inconsistent eating patterns and mental challenges by adding quality foods into their diet 
    and making small, simple changes. The Epigenetic Hair Analysis gives an individualized report of nutritional needs 
    so that changes can be made based on what you are lacking and need more of!`

    I’ve never met a beach I didn’t like and I’m not embarrassed to say that my family has been to Disneyland several 
    dozen times. And I believe that good health results from positivity, effort and consistency.`,
    p2: `My Interest in creating and maintaining a healthy lifestyle was magnified in 2019 when I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. 
    Although I has a long-standing interest in nutrition and environment as it related to overall health, for much of my life 
    I depended on good genetics. My interest shifted into overdrive when my health was threatened. Once my treatment was complete, 
    I bean to research additional way that I could enhance my health to promote longevity and vigor. I was frustrated with the 
    differing opinions on which and how many supplements I should take. I was curious about why I had developed food 
    sensitivities and whether they were hindering my health. What did my body really need? For me, hair analysis was 
    an empowering tool to help me feel proactive and informed about what my body was asking for. I felt like I had been 
    given a roadmap to help me on my health journey. The whole process really resonated with me – so much so that I decided 
    to become certified to do hair analysis. I’ve learned so much and I’m excited to become an Integrated Health Practitioner. 
    By nature, I like serving and delighted that I can help others discover their own roadmaps to better health!`

    p1: `Health has always interested me, but it wasn’t until I experienced my own health issues—gut problems, food allergies, 
    and food sensitivities—that I took a deep dive into learning how to heal my body through food and other holistic methods. 
    These practices healed my gut, many of my food allergies and sensitivities, depression, and brain fog. We live in a world that 
    claims to have many silver bullets to living a healthy and better life. I have learned that our bodies are unique and there is 
    no silver bullet for healing, but we can use food as medicine to heal our bodies from the many ailments we face.`,
    p2: `I am a certified holistic health coach and love to help people learn about the power of food, supplements, movement, and 
    mindfulness. I believe that what we eat, drink, and put into and onto our bodies affects how we feel and how our body functions. 
    I am passionate about helping my clients learn how to nourish their bodies, souls, and minds. The Epigenetic Hair Analysis is a 
    tool I use to help my clients see tangible evidence of what is going on inside their bodies. Together, we will put a plan in place 
    to help you transform your life.`
