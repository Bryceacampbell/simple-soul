            After setting up an appointment you can plan on your on about and hour and fifteen minutes the day 
            of your scan. There is no special prep needed. We use the bulb of your hair. Unaffected by shampoos 
            or hair dye, or other outside environmental factors. Small tweezers are used to grab 3-4 hair bulbs, 
            thatâ€™s it!! Bulbs are placed on the scanner and we receive your report back on the computer in roughly 
            12-15min. From there we carefully go through your report analyzing all the info. Three very specific 
            pages are given to us first. Your immune system, gut health and cardiovascular system. Each page is 
            detailed with key nutrients needed to properly function each of those systems. As well as looking over 
            any frequencies or environmental issues that could be causing the system to not perform its best. From 
            there we look deeper into specific vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, antioxidants as well as good 
            additives that could be affecting you. At the end the report compiles with priority how you can best 
            optimizes your health. It tells us exactly where the body is lacking the most and what foods will help 
            to bring those deficiencies up. It will also guide us to what foods you should avoid as well as food 
            sensitivities as over time they create imbalances in our system.

          The goal is to attack those areas lacking the most nutritionally to help them carry out there specific
