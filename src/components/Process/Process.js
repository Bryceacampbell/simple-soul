            We use small tweezers to grab 3-4 hair bulbs, which are then placed on
            our scanner. Your report is sent back in roughly 12-15 minutes.
            Then, we thoroughly analyze all the information in the report and
            develop a 90 day personalized health optimization plan.

            or hair dye, or other outside environmental factors. Small tweezers are used to grab 3-4 hair bulbs, 
            thatâ€™s it!! Bulbs are placed on the scanner and we receive your report back on the computer in roughly 
            12-15min. From there we carefully go through your report analyzing all the info. Three very specific 
            pages are given to us first. Your immune system, gut health and cardiovascular system. Each page is 
            detailed with key nutrients needed to properly function each of those systems. As well as looking over 
            any frequencies or environmental issues that could be causing the system to not perform its best. From 
            there we look deeper into specific vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, antioxidants as well as good 
            additives that could be affecting you. At the end the report compiles with priority how you can best 
            optimizes your health. It tells us exactly where the body is lacking the most and what foods will help 
            to bring those deficiencies up. It will also guide us to what foods you should avoid as well as food 
            sensitivities as over time they create imbalances in our system. */}
